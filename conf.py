# -- Path setup --------------------------------------------------------------

# add these directories to sys.path here. If the directory is relative to the
# documentation root, use os.path.abspath to make it absolute, like shown here.
#
# import os
# import sys
# sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('.'))

# extensions coming with Sphinx (named 'sphinx.ext.*') or your custom
# ones.
