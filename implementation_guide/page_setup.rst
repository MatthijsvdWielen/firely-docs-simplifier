.. _ig_page_setup:

Page setup and reuse
====================

This page covers how individual guide pages are wired together: page headers, guide-wide variables, reusable templates, links, images, and formatting. Setting these up well saves you repeating yourself and keeps the guide consistent as it grows.

Page headers
------------

The YAML header of a page (the part between the ``---`` lines) sets properties that affect the whole page:

::

   ---
   topic: MyPatientPage
   subject: Patient
   expand: 2
   ---

- **topic**: a stable name you can link to from other pages (see `Linking to pages`_). Linking by topic keeps working even when the guide is published, exported, or copied.
- **subject** (or ``name`` / ``canonical``): sets the page's resource scope. When set, the ``tree``, ``xml``, ``json`` (and other) widgets on the page no longer need a canonical parameter, which makes pages much easier to write and maintain. This is especially useful with templating.
- **expand**: ``1``, ``2``, ... expands resource trees to that depth; ``yes`` expands fully. Works for StructureDefinitions and example instances.
- **lang**: sets the page language; all language-aware renderers pick it up automatically.

Any property that a rendering widget understands (such as ``buttons``, ``diff``, ``hybrid``) can also be set in the header.

Variables
---------

A variable is a property with a name you pick yourself. Simplifier resolves a variable by looking, from most specific to most general:

1. the arguments of the placeholder call itself
2. the page's YAML header
3. ``variables.yaml`` in the root of your guide
4. the built-in guide properties

The first match wins, so a page header overrides ``variables.yaml``, which overrides the built-ins.

These variables are always available: ``guide-title``, ``guide-description``, ``guide-version``, ``guide-fhir-version``, and ``scope`` (the project or package the guide renders against).

Defining variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``variables.yaml`` file in the root of your guide acts like an invisible page: instead of content, it holds variables you define once and reuse across the guide. Add it from the IG editor tree. Write plain YAML, without ``---`` fences:

::

   patient-profile: http://example.org/StructureDefinition/MyPatient
   ballotStatus: draft

You can also use it for guide-wide settings, such as the tree ``expand:`` option (for example ``expand: yes`` to expand every level, or ``expand: 3`` for the third level).

The same keys work in a page's YAML header, where they apply to that page only:

::

   ---
   topic: MyPatientPage
   ballotStatus: final
   ---

Only simple key/value pairs are read; nested YAML and lists are ignored. Keep to letters, digits, and underscores in your own variable names, so they stay usable in FQL and PlantUML.

Using variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- On any page, and in the guide's master template: ``{{variable: ballotStatus}}``. Intellisense lists the variables it knows about.
- In an FQL query: ``%ballotStatus`` (see :ref:`FQL page variables <fql_syntax>`).
- In a PlantUML diagram: ``!$ballotStatus``. Dashes in a name become underscores here, so ``guide-title`` is ``!$guide_title``.

Reusing variables across pages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A page header variable is also visible in whatever that page pulls in with ``{{page:}}``, which is what makes templating work: the template reads the variables, each page sets them. You can pass one-off values in the call itself:

::

   {{page: yourTemplatingPage, ballotStatus: draft}}

This is how you describe several resources on one page while writing the layout only once. Two hidden template pages, each with a topic and no scope of its own:

``fql-get-resource-description``

::

   ---
   topic: fql-get-resource-description
   ---

   <fql output="inline">
   from
       StructureDefinition
   where
       url = %canonical
   select
       description
   </fql>

``resource-lm-view-tree``

::

   ---
   topic: resource-lm-view-tree
   ---

   <tabs>
      <tab title="Tree view" active="true">
         {{tree, hybrid}}
      </tab>
      <tab title="Mappings">
         {{page:fql-get-lm-mappings}}
      </tab>
      <tab title="Xml">
         {{xml}}
      </tab>
      <tab title="Json">
         {{json}}
      </tab>
   </tabs>

And the visible page that applies them once per resource, passing the canonical in the call:

::

   ---
   topic: LogicalModelsOverview
   expand: yes
   ---

   # Page describing multiple resources

   ## Endpoint

   {{page: fql-get-resource-description, canonical: http://example.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/lm-Endpoint}}

   {{page: resource-lm-view-tree, canonical: http://example.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/lm-Endpoint}}

   ## ExecutionOrder

   {{page: fql-get-resource-description, canonical: http://example.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/lm-ExecutionOrder}}

   {{page: resource-lm-view-tree, canonical: http://example.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/lm-ExecutionOrder}}

The ``canonical`` from the call sets the scope for the included page, so ``{{tree}}`` needs no parameter and the query picks the same value up as ``%canonical``. ``expand: yes`` in the header applies to every tree on the page.

.. note::

   Widget parameters are read literally, so ``{{tree: %patient-profile}}`` and ``{{tree: {{variable: patient-profile}}}}`` do not work. To point a widget at a different resource per page, set the scope in the page header (``subject``, ``canonical``, or ``name``) and leave the widget's parameter empty, as described under `Templating`_. The same goes for options such as ``expand``, ``buttons``, and ``diff``.

Templating
----------

.. note::

   Templating is a beta feature. Be careful using it in production. It also works for FQL tables, except for FQL tables placed inside custom tables or tabs.

With the ``{{page:}}`` placeholder you can render a hidden page as a template, so all your resource pages share one consistent layout.

1. **Create a hidden template page** (not available in legacy guides) and give it a topic. Use widgets without a scope, for example a tabbed tree/XML/JSON view. The preview on the template page itself shows errors because it has no scope; that is expected and does not affect pages that apply the template.

   ::

      ---
      topic: yourTemplatingPage
      ---

2. **Set the scope on each resource page** via its YAML header (``subject``, ``canonical``, or ``name``).

3. **Apply the template** on a resource page with the ``{{page:}}`` placeholder, referencing the template's topic (or its location):

   ::

      {{page: yourTemplatingPage}}
      {{page: Home/IG folder/pagename}}

   The placeholder renders the template, filling its widgets (``{{tree}}``, ``{{xml}}``, ``{{json}}``, ...) from the resource page's scope.

.. _pagelinkingTopic:

Linking to pages
----------------

Use the ``pagelink`` placeholder to link to another page in your guide, on any page and in the guide's master template. Linking by **topic** is recommended: it keeps working even when a page's URL key or folder structure changes, or when the guide is exported or copied.

Set a topic in the page's YAML header:

::

   ---
   topic: yourpagename
   ---

Then link to it:

- Standard: ``{{pagelink:yourpagename}}``
- Custom text and hint: ``{{pagelink:yourpagename, text:Link Title, hint:Mouseover Text}}``
- To a specific section, add an anchor. Give the target heading a custom id (``# Target Heading {#your-anchor-name}``), then link with ``{{pagelink:path/to/page.md, anchor:your-anchor-name}}``.

Linking to resources and examples
---------------------------------

The recommended way to link to a resource or example is by resource id, so the link keeps working when the guide is exported or duplicated. Always provide the resource type. The ``link``, ``xml``, and ``json`` widgets all work this way:

::

   {{link: Patient/child-example}}
   {{json: Patient/child-example}}

To link to a profile, use its canonical URL: ``{{link:http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Patient}}`` (add ``, title:'Base Patient'`` for custom link text). The profile's package must be in your IG scope.

Images
------

Upload an image to a project and render it with the ``render`` widget, selecting the project and image URL key (Intellisense helps you pick them):

::

   {{render:demo/simplifier-logo-png}}

You can also use standard markdown image syntax for external images.

Formatting, tables, and lists
-----------------------------

Standard markdown works for text formatting, tables, and lists. For example, a table:

::

   |Header|Header|Header|
   |-|-|-|
   |content|content|content|

And lists::

   - Item 1
   - Item 2
     - Sub item 2.1

   1. First
   2. Second

For dynamic tables, use :ref:`FQL tables <ig_rendering_fhir>`; for diagrams, see :doc:`PlantUML <simplifierPlantUML>`.
